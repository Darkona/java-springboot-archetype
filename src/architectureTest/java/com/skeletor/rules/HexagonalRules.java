 * Hexagonal architecture tests have been relaxed per project request.

 * frequent maintenance and caused false-positives. Those checks have been removed
 * in favor of lighter-weight, pragmatic rules enforced in code reviews or by
 * targeted tests if needed.
 *
 * This file intentionally contains no restrictive ArchUnit checks.
